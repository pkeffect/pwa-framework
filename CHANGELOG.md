grep "Generated by PWA Framework Generator" <project>/README.md
```

## Migration Guides

### 1.x → 2.0

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite. To migrate existing projects:

1. Generate a fresh 2.0 framework
2. Copy your custom game logic from `js/scenes/GameScene.js`
3. Migrate assets from `assets/` directory
4. Update any custom UI in `index.html`
5. Review new security features (CSP, SRI)

Breaking changes:
- Scene lifecycle methods now required (`enter`, `update`, `render`, `exit`)
- Asset loader uses chunked loading with retry logic
- High DPI rendering requires devicePixelRatio scaling

## Contributing

When adding features:

1. Update `SCRIPT_VERSION` constant in `pwa_create.py`
2. Add entry to this CHANGELOG under `[Unreleased]`
3. Update version badge in `README.md`
4. Update version in `DEVELOPER.md` and `AUDIT.md` headers
5. Run test suite to verify all 24 files generate correctly
