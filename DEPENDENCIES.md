# This project has ZERO Python dependencies (stdlib only)
# No requirements.txt, no package.json, no Gemfile
# 
# If you add external dependencies:
# 1. You're breaking the core philosophy (see README.md)
# 2. Update DEVELOPER.md to document why
# 3. Add appropriate dependency management files
# 4. Configure Dependabot in .github/dependabot.yml
# 5. Add security scanning to CI workflows
#
# Generated frameworks also have zero dependencies by design.
# They use vanilla ES6 modules - no npm, no bundler.
